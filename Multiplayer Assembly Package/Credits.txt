I would like to thank Wei Dai for the wonderful library and all the help
you provided to me to get my cryptograpy methods working with Torque 3D

I Would also like to thank Geoff Beier for assisting me with the problems
with the AES encryption and helping me to get that functioning properly

cURL:
I would like to thank Daniel Stenberg for the constant development and support
of the cURL library, to without which, my TCPObjects would still be haunting
my authentication memories to this day.

To whom without, this pack would never have seen the light of day, thank you
GarageGames, for the wonderful Torque 3D engine!

And my personal shout out to the community over at GG, you guys are the best

the help of the community, this one is for you.
