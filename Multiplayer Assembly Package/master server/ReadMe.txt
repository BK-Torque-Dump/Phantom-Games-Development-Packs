These are the files necessary to install the PHP Master Server Replacement.

I kept them separately from the main pack in-case some of you only want to install the master
server and not all of MAP.

NOTE: the cURL folder inside the lib folder (engine/lib) is exactly the same as the one
for installing MAP, so if you've already installed MAP, you don't need to put in the new
files for cURL.

Please see the master server install document for more info.
