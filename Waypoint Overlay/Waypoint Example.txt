Here is an example for a waypoint used by the GUI:

%waypoint = new  (WayPoint)(){
   dataBlock        = WayPointMarker;
   position         = %position;
   name             = "Test";
   scale            = "0.1 0.1 0.1";
   team             = %team;
};
MissionCleanup.add(%waypoint);
%waypoint.setTeam(%team);
%waypoint.setShapeIcon("path/to/icon.png");

Waypoints that are rendered must have a shapeIcon assigned to it.

On the client, attach the GuiWaypointOverlay to your playGui and cover the entire screen with it.
Then use the following code on the overlay:

%overlay = ...; //Replace with overlay object.
%overlay.setTeamColor(0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0);
%overlay.setTeamColor(1, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0); //1 - Green
%overlay.setTeamColor(2, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0); //2 - Red

A clever person, could use this to have teams show friendly icons as one color, and enemy icons as 
another:

function clientCmdSetColor(%team, %color) {
   %overlay = ...; //Replace with overlay object.
   %overlay.setTeamColor(%team, getWord(%color, 0), getWord(%color, 1), getWord(%color, 2));
}

And then on the server end, you can force the client color with:

commandToClient(%client, 'SetColor', %team, %color);

The client end can also obtain the color string of the current color by using:
%color = %overlay.getTeamColor(%team);
